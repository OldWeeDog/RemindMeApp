# RemindMeApp
Final Project App
A new app that I had to do for Uni. 
Licensed under GPLv3. Uni Project This is an app that's to be built for a UNI project. 
The app will be suitable for any general user from highschool age upwards. 
It will basically be an installable notepad / to do /shopping list app with particular focus on the shopping list portion. To remind people to do stuff because people have such busy lifestyles these days.
There is a Json file that belongs to the app that goes in the resources folder.
The username and pssword for the Login part of the app has been set to "admin" .
